<hr>
Algorithms used: </br>
Weighted Averages count of movieratings.</br>
Found Similar raters using dot-product-of-closeness-mean for all raters to the user(input id).</br>

<a href="https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//capstone/recommender.php?id=xqsLtSbzOkCgjA">Run my project hosted on dukee University website</a>

The interface is offered by Duke University.

This project recommend movies based on the similarity of ratings the user gives and those of professional raters given on IDMB, which is to say, you are more likely to share similarities with the raters who rate movies like you do. Then what movies to be recommeded are those the similar raters think very highly of.

Steps:</br>
Read in and parse move and rating data into lists and maps.</br>
Calculate average ratings.</br>
Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings.</br>
Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.</br>
Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.</br>
